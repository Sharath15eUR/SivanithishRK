Write a C Program to find HCF of 4 given numbers using recursive function.

      #include<stdio.h>
      int HCF(int, int); //You have to write this function which calculates the HCF. 
	 
      int main()
      {
      int a, b, c, d, result;
      scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a, &b, &c, &d); /* Takes 4 number as input from the test data */
      result = HCF(HCF(a, b), HCF(c,d));
      printf("The HCF is %d", result);
     }

     //Complete the rest of the program to calculate HCF
     int HCF(int a,int b)
     {
     if(b==0)
       return a;
     else 
       return HCF(b,a%b);
    }
