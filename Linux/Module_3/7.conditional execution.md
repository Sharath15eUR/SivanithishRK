Conditional execution

1) Write a script which will take your name as an input.
2) It should check this name with your system's username.
3) If the username matches, it should greet you by displaying "Hello".
4) Else, it should display "Try again"

HINT: Your system's username is stored in a variable $USER 

              #!/bin/bash
              user=$USER
              read -p "Enter your username:" username
              if [ "$user" == "$username" ]; 
              then
                 echo "HELLO"
              else 
                  echo "Try Again"
              fi
