1) Write a program to demonstrate the use of not equal to operator.
   Hint: -ne

          #!/bin/bash
          echo "Enter a number:"
          read num
          if [ $num -ne 0 ] ; then 
              echo "It is a non zero number"
          elif [ $num -eq 0 ] ; then 
              echo "The given number is zero"
          fi
