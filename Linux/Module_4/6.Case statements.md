Case statement

1) Write a menu driven program for mathematical calculation
   a. It should take user inputs a and b
   b. It should ask for mathematical operator (+, -, / and *).
   c. Do the calculation
   d. Print the output

              #!/usr/bin/env bash

              read -p "Enter num1" a
              read -p "Enter num2" b

              read -p "Enter the operation (+,-,/,*)" var

              case $var in
                 [+]) 
                 echo "sum of two numbers is $((a+b))"
                 ;;
                 [-])
                 echo "Difference of two numbers is $((a-b))"
                 ;;
                 [/])
                 echo "$a divided by $b is $((a/b))"
                 ;;
                 [*])
                 echo "$a multiplied by $b is $((a*b))"
                 ;;
                 *) 
                 echo "invalid operation"
                 ;;
 
                 esac
